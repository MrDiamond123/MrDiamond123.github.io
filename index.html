            <p>Hi! I am Kurtis! I am nonbinary (boyish?) <i id="age">18 years old</i> nerd!
                 I am currently a student studying business and marketing. 
                 I am passionate about marketing, technology, and trying to make the world a better place!

                <h3>iTEAM Corporation (OSTC - Enterpreneurship and Advanced Marketing)</h3>
                <p>
                    OSTC was ran like a business, where my first year I was an associate and my second year I was a vice-president. During my first year, I learned a lot about marketing, business, and customer service and my second year took my knowledge and challenged it by having me apply it not only to myself but also directly helping others learn and apply their skills.

                        <h5>Ultimate Sales Challenge</h5>
                        <p>Ultimate Sales Challenge is the first project we do each year in which we had to try to sell food, drinks, a non-food item, and a pay-to-participate activity 
                            (first year, when programming and enterpreneurship were a combined class, also included programming developing a game in Unity).
                            First year, our team won the challenge! Second year, I wore a inflatable Pikachu Among Us costume (we did not win)!</p>

                        <h5>Corporate Battle</h5>
                        <p>Corporate Battle is the second project we work on. It's a competition between the AM and PM classes, where we have to put on an event with Oakland County Parks to both encourage job applications and to have a fun events for families to attend! For the first year, we had various Unity games that the programmers developed and I provided programming and technical assistance. I had also developed a career quiz to help the people seeking jobs figure out which job would be the best for them. Second year, I had also consulted with the programmer who developed a new version of the career quiz. First year, we had won against PM and second year, while we lost, it was extremely close. </p>

                    <h4>Cool thing I did in high school </h4>
                    <p>An assignment I had for my LA 11 class was to make a infomercial for a fake product. My group's product was a pen recorded called the Soundscribe. As part of this project, I was the narrator, actor number 1, and video editor. This infomercial allowed us to express our creativity in a fun way and allowed me to practice and show off my video editing skills!  </p>
